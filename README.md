This project consists of an Iterated function system editor written in Python code in 2015.  I stuck to some basic tools like TKinter.  One of the projects was for my Math 595 computer animation class, but afterwards I tweaked it a bit to allow for some user friendly features.  As of now the project is incomplete, but the generation function systems employing up to 8 functions is working perfectly well.
