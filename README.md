This project consists of an Iterated function system editor written in Python code in 2015.  I stuck to some basic tools like TKinter.  One of the projects was for my Math 595 computer animation class, but afterwards I tweaked it a bit to allow for some user friendly features.  As of now the project is incomplete, but the generation function systems employing up to 8 functions is working perfectly well.  
Current bug to fix: create_square function is often called, but it doesn't clear the undo history, so if you create a new square in the middle of your usage of the function call, you will get your configuration order mixed up.
